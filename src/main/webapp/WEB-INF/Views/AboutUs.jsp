      The premium handbags and accessories market in the U.S. continues to grow ,
       but what could worry retailers is the slowing growth rate for this market. Although this segment is expected to grow 3% to $11.7 billion in 2015, according to Barclays , this growth rate has declined from 8% in 2014, 11% in 2013, and 16% in 2012. Coach is in the midst of a rebranding and transformation plan, prompted by the continuously slowing sales numbers, and Michael Kors is losing its “cool” factor. Kate Spade, on the other hand, reported impressive earnings in the third quarter of 2015. It witnessed a growth in its comparable direct-to-consumer net sales of 16.0% year-over-year, and its North American segment reported a rise in its average revenue per square foot of 5%.
